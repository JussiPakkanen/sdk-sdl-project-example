SDL Application Example for use with Qt Creator
-----------------------------------------------

For now, we have to resort to setting up custom build and deploy steps, as the
current SDK version is tightly integrated with Qt Creator and qmake. The steps
are easy, and you can customize each step. "mb2 build" uses the configure,
build and install steps defined in the .spec file, and also makes sure all
build dependencies are installed properly (so list them in the .spec file).

You can also use other build systems (e.g. autotools or cmake) as long as you
state your build-dependencies correctly in the .spec file and as long as you
add the right "configure" command to the %prep step in the .spec file.

The SOURCES, HEADERS and OTHER_FILES variables in the .pro file are used to
display the source files in the Qt Creator IDE. They are not used for building.


Here's how you configure Qt Creator to build the project:


1. Open the .pro file in Qt Creator


2. Modify the project build settings:

    General:

        Disable the "Shadow build" setting

    Build Steps:

        Remove ALL steps, then add a new one:

        Custom Process Step

                  Command: sdk/target
                Arguments: mb2 build
        Working directory: %{buildDir}

    Clean Steps:

        Remove ALL steps, then add a new one:

        Custom Process Step

                  Command: sdk/target
                Arguments: sb2 make clean
        Working directory: %{buildDir}


3. Modify the project run settings:

    Deployment:

        Remove ALL steps (except the "Start Emulator" one), then add a new one:

        Custom Process Step

                  Command: sdk/target
                Arguments: mb2 deploy --pkcon
        Working directory: %{buildDir}


    Run:

        Custom Process Step

                  Command: sdk/target
                Arguments: mb2 run /usr/bin/harbour-sdltest
        Working directory: %{buildDir}

        (if you change the application binary name, you have to customize the
        name here; simply replace /usr/bin/harbour-sdltest with
        /usr/bin/$APPNAME)


4. If you want to have a target device other than "SailfishOS Emulator",
   you need to modify the DEPLOYMENT_DEVICE variable in sdk/target.
